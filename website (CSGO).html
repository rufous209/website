CSGO is my favorite game. It is a first person shooter. 
In the game there are two teams that fight<br>. There are  multiple game modes in CSGO and are really fun to play with friends an progress through. The game modes in CSGO are,

<li>Death match<li>
<li>casual<li>
<li>competitive<li>
<li>arms race<li>
<li>flying scouts men<li>
</body>
<br>

These are the best game modes.

CSGO is a team based game. On competitive there are 5 people on each side.
<br>
On T side they either have to kill the other team or plant the bomb, and the 
CT site <br>either have to kill the other team as well or defuse the bomb.Or if the t <br>
side cant plant but they don't die CT side win.

There is a good variety of guns in CSGO such as the AK 47,AWP, M4A4,Desert Eagle.e.g.<br>
To get these guns you need to get money(in game)by getting kills or planting the bomb.<br>
different guns also give you different amounts of money, such as smg's give you money money than a rifle.<br>
All guns have their own skins as well witch  you get from earning them unboxing them from a case or just buying them.<br>
